### Description

Customize your menu with images.

Just create a menu with the VB Menu editor. Add some PictureBoxes to your form and assign to the CMenu class.

This class uses the whole region of the main-menu not only the regions of the items. So, if the window width changes, the background image of the main-menu also does.

The screenshot shows where PictureBoxes are applied.

UPDATE:

Now using a better method for subclassing. A MsgBox blocked the WM_DRAWITEM message when running in the IDE and as long as the msgbox was on top, the menubar was grey. This doesn't happen in the new version.
